                <h1>Affordable Professional Indie Game Design</h1>
                <p>No doubt since its Code Editor were talking about one should know come code to get around.
                             When I started writing this article I knew just a bit of CSS but got fascinated by the
                              vast possibilities I saw with Launch Code STL.
                              <p> So I did as I always do facing a new riddle to solve so I googled. 
                               I turned out there are complete and easy step by step tutorials and references about HTML,
                                CSS and Bootstrap all brought together at one place  the W3C Schools page.</p> 
                                They have got some cool ready-made code examples to get you started too.
                                 With the help of this web library and my inborn curiosity and stubbornness
                                  I successfully got to the results presented to you in this article.</p> 
                                <p>What’s also interesting is that this small population of users are not just going to spend money once, assuming you have content that can be purchased often (coins, credits, etc). If they love what they’re getting, they’ll spend a lot. They’ll keep coming back and spending over and over. In the business, these are called “whales” -
                                     people that account for a disproportionate amount of revenue</p>

                                   <p>A small population that spends lot of money can make any business successful. 
                                        In the United States, we have a similar bell curve - the top 0.5% of the population owns an enormous amount of wealth and money. They also pay the most in taxes for the government - nearly 30% of total revenues. 
                                        A few thousand people paying billions - the same is true in an app with a few thousand people purchasing tons of in-app purchases</p>  
                                    <p> The reason I am telling you this is because your will be MUCH more successful in most of your app monetization endeavors (especially in-app purchase driven apps) if you focus as most of your effort on the “whales.”
 
                                            Why?
                                            • They have the money to spend
                                            • They want to spend it
                                            • They WILL actually spend it on content they want
                                            Don’t spend your time trying to get users to go from 0 to $1. Spend your time getting users to go from $1 to $1,000. 
                                            As you build your app and begin updating it, keep this in mind. You will drastically increase your ROI by doing so.

                                    <h1>What Is Indie Game Development?</h1>

                                    Indie, which is short for “independent”, refers to a game made by one person or a small team, especially one without financial support from a publisher.
                                    This means that unlike the big-budget titles made by the top developers, indie games are made by people working on their own dime.
                                    While some of these projects obtain help from crowd-funding sources such as Kickstarter and
                                     Indiegogo, usually it’s still not enough to cover funding expenses, not to mention costs for marketing and other assets.
                                    <p> <h1>What Is The Alternative?</h1>

                                            Your other choice is to work at a video game studio where you’ll work with a large team and receive an annual salary.
                                            This is the most common route taken by aspiring game developers because it means you’re actually getting paid for your work.
                                            Of course, working for a company means you probably won’t have the same freedom as an indie developer.
                                            Where Do I Start?
                                            
                                            That’s the thing; you can become an indie game developer whenever you want.
                                            Whatever your game development skills may be, start using them to create a game 
                                            either by yourself or with a team of other developers.
                                            Anyone from students in college to people with full-time professional
                                             jobs can be considered an indie dev as long as they’re working on a game project.

                                    </p><h1>Pros and Cons of Indie Game Development</h1>

                                    Pro — Creative & Professional Freedom

                                   <p>This is probably the biggest reason many developer are tempted to go indie.
                                    While getting paid to work on someone else’s idea at an established studio is fine, there’s nothing quite like bringing your own ideas to life.
                                    Being indie also means you get to work on your own schedule, which means no one pushing you to meet milestones, asking you to crunch for several more hours, etc.
                                    Con — Tight (Or No) Funds</P>
                                    
                                    <p>>Game development, even small projects, are costly and time-consuming endeavors. Indie developers have to figure out how to pay for resources while also finding a way to cover their own expenses, including food, rent, and more.
                                    Since no one is paying you to develop the game, indie developers often quit when they run out of cash or can’t handle working a job by day and their game during their free time.
                                    Pro — Expanding Your Skill Set</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Since most indie game teams consist of only a couple of people, chances are each person is going to be taking on more than one role.
                                    It’s not uncommon for the programmer to also help out with sound and music or for an artist to handle the marketing and promotion side of things.
                                    This means that as an indie game developer you’ll probably get valuable knowledge on different areas of game development, including art, storytelling, sound, coding, and more, all while perfectly your main talent.
                                    Con — No Big Projects</p>
                                    
                                    Some of the most captivating and innovative video game experiences have come from passionate and dedicated indie developers.
                                    So to say that small game projects can’t be good is a lie. However, as an indie developer you’ll never get the chance to work on the biggest projects in the industry.
                                    One of the coolest things about working at a game studio is helping to create huge titles that really push the limits of their respective platform, all alongside a strong team of fellow developers.
                                    There’s certainly strength in numbers when it comes to game development.
                                    <p>

            <h1> How I Created an Indie Game Studio for Less Than $500 BUCKS! </h1>
            <p> A Brief Lesson In App Economics
                    As you know by now, I’m a big believer in knowledge. The more you know, the better your business will be. When it comes to money, especially when you’re in a marketing focused business like apps, it’s important to understand how money goes from one place to another. 
                    I’m going to break this into two parts because there 
                    are two major pieces to this puzzle: the app user profile and the market profile.
            </p>

            You may think that a LOT of people will spend money in your app. It’s easy to 
            think that 30%, 40%, even 50% of people will like it enough to spend money. Unfortunately, that’s not really true. 
            Not even close. 
In fact, the number is going to be closer to 5% of your user base.
 These are people that decide something in the app is worth purchasing and press that confirmation popup. Of course, some apps have much higher (and much lower) numbers than this, but 5% is a good place to start.
This is not new - in almost all businesses you’ll see similar patterns to this. Before you start feeling hopeless, please realize that this is NOT a bad thing at all

This is the story about my quest to create an indie game studio for less than $500.</h2>
       <p> The first image of Corporate Game is hard to pin down. However, the history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s,</p>
         when academic computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations as part of their research. 
         
<h>Why Video Gaming Not Reach Mainstream</h2>
<p> Video gaming did not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s,
          when video arcade games and gaming consoles using joysticks, buttons,
           and other controllers, along with graphics on computer screens and home computer
            games were introduced to the general public.</p> 
            <p> Since the 1980s,video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of
              modern popular culture in most parts of the world. One of the early 
              games was Spacewar!, which was developed by computer scientists. 
              Early arcade video games developed from 1972 to 1978.
               During the 1970s, the first generation of home consoles emerged,
                including the popular game Pong and various "clones". </p>
                The 1970s was also the era of mainframe computer games. The golden age of
                 arcade video games was from 1978 to 1982. Video arcades with large,
                  graphics-decorated coin-operated machines were common at malls and popular, 
                  affordable home consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Intellivision enabled people
                   to play games on their home TVs. During the 1980s, gaming computers, early online gaming and handheld LCD games emerged; this era was affected by the video game crash of 1983.
         From 1976 to 1992, the second generation of video consoles emerged. </p>

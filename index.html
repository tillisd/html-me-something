This is the story about my quest to create an indie game studio for less than $500.</h2>
       <p> The first image of Corporate Game is hard to pin down. However, the history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s,</p>
         when academic computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations as part of their research. 
         
<h>Why Video Gaming Not Reach Mainstream</h2>
<p> Video gaming did not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s,
          when video arcade games and gaming consoles using joysticks, buttons,
           and other controllers, along with graphics on computer screens and home computer
            games were introduced to the general public.</p> 
            <p> Since the 1980s,video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of
              modern popular culture in most parts of the world. One of the early 
              games was Spacewar!, which was developed by computer scientists. 
              Early arcade video games developed from 1972 to 1978.
               During the 1970s, the first generation of home consoles emerged,
                including the popular game Pong and various "clones". </p>
                The 1970s was also the era of mainframe computer games. The golden age of
                 arcade video games was from 1978 to 1982. Video arcades with large,
                  graphics-decorated coin-operated machines were common at malls and popular, 
                  affordable home consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Intellivision enabled people
                   to play games on their home TVs. During the 1980s, gaming computers, early online gaming and handheld LCD games emerged; this era was affected by the video game crash of 1983.
         From 1976 to 1992, the second generation of video consoles emerged. </p>

<p>No doubt since its Code Editor were talking about one should know come code to get around.
     When I started writing this article I knew just a bit of CSS but got fascinated by the
      vast possibilities I saw with Launch Code STL.
       So I did as I always do facing a new riddle to solve so I googled. 
       I turned out there are complete and easy step by step tutorials and references about HTML,
        CSS and Bootstrap all brought together at one place  the W3C Schools page. 
        They have got some cool ready-made code examples to get you started too.
         With the help of this web library and my inborn curiosity and stubbornness
          I successfully got to the results presented to you in this article.</p>
